"""

Logic concerning a coordinate system that is extensible to as many dimensions
as one could possibly desire, aka. the practical limits on built-in lists of
integers.

This construct is likely impractical for several reasons.  First, this
construct is optimal pretty much only when the number of dimensions in the
coordinate system will change over the course of the programâ€™s execution, which
is highly unlikely in any practical application. Second, because humans cannot
see in more than 3 dimensions, your needs are likely better covered by another
package such as coordinate, numpy, or the coordinate type of whatever graphics
library is being used, but this was fun to make anyway.
